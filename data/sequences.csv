1592," Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. ",7," ...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block.

1608, You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youre still gonna date him? ,4," Oh, Im so sorry. Um, and maybe Im wrong! I butyknow Im gonna go out with him again, Ill find out more. ",
1609, I always knew you were gonna make it. Im so proud of you. ,9," Its not just the stuff he paid for, I mean its-its everything. Yknow? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didnt get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didnt believe in myself. ",
1610, Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose? ,2, It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing! ,

1616, You're kidding! ,2, She died. ,
1617," Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? ",1," You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. ",
1618," I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . _B_ Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. _B_ That's actually good. _B_ ",2," Chandler, Chandler. ",

1623," Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples. ",0," He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it. ",
1624," Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules ",5," And its not fake, its totally brutal. ",
1625, Is it on? ,5,  Oh-oh-oh-oh! ,
1626," You mean like, music? _B_ ",4," What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus its just, its so different from the stuff you usually hear. ",
1627, Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night! ,9, says $30 Father; same as in town.  _B_ ,
1628,  Okay.  But it is officially nighttime.  ,2," Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative. ",

1630," Look at us, were a couple of couples! ",8," I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one! ",
1631, Hey! Howd the audition go? ,8,  Hey. ,
1632," Oh, dont worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody. _B_ ",6," I dont know, yknow? I feel a little umm No, yknow what? Never mind, Im gonna be fine. ",
1633," Definitely roses.  Well, I just think theyre a little more weddingy.  But Lilies are the clear choice. ",9, Yeah! Roses or Lilies?  ,
1634," Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it? _B_ ",1," Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.  Kind of what probably really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" yknow? I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging all my hopes of Rachel and I living together on-on ""Probably!"" Yknow? You gotta take care of yourselves!  In this world history teaches us nothing!  ",
1635," Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.  _B_ Dr. ",1," Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys? ",
1636," Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically. ",0, Why won't I be married when I'm 40? ,
1637, Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  Theres no Anderson. ,8, Is your team winning hon? ,
1638, Why do you want to play this game so bad? ,1," No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why dont you go home and wait for the thank you card? ",
1639, I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. ,4," Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey... ",

I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?  ",0," Oh, why is it unfair? ",
5019,"  Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!  ",7, What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close? ,

Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout! ",5, Uh huh. Why is that? ,

What the hells a matter with you? How do you think Joeys going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter? ,
5027,  Hey! Which ones my turkey burger? ,1," Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else? ",
5028," Oh, yeah, I dont know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.  ",2," Well I assume the ah, happy couple isnt up yet. Did you guys hear them last night? ",
5029, What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!! ,1,"  Awww, man! He promised he wouldnt take the chairs!! ",

5032, Sorry.  ,0, Dude! ,
5033," Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women. ",3," Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me. ",
5034," Okay, listen this really hurts. Lets go. ",2, Im pretty sure its gun. ,
5035, Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo! ,9, Ah whatever! _B_ ,

5038, Thats Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano. ,5, What? ,
5039," God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go? ",1, No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark. ,
5040," Oh yeah, well, can you picture me saying, ""Go to your room! You're grounded!"" ",9, I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad. At the fun parts and at the hard parts. ,
5041,  That's the perfect amount! ,8, Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage. ,
5042," My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.  ",4, No you did. ,
5043,  They're out there! ,6, Do you hear something?  ,

5045," Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that? ",0, 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. ,
5046, We're not gonna talk about girth are we? ,3," Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna? ",
5047," Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order. ",5," What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her? ",

5049, Wow! Look at them run. ,7, Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.  ,
5050," Okay, well it this bed isnt new, how come there is plastic on the mattress? ",2," So. This has always been Monicas bed, what youre just noticing now, how self-involved are you? ",
5051," Come on, tell me. ",3," Well, it doesnt matter what I would do. ",
5052, Freedom! ,8, Foot rubs for a month! ,
5053, I know! I know! ,4," Yknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people! ",
5054, I'm still mad at you for not telling me. ,6," Me neither, y'know what- ",
5055, Let's go quicker. ,5," Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it. ",
5056," Well, why can't you do them tomorrow? ",2,  I didn't finish my five pages. ,

5058, You dove in front of Ross! Ross! ,9, Okay. ,
5059," All right, let me in.  ",4, That's right baby. ,
5060, When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it! ,8," It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me? ",
5061,  What? What? ,1, I thought it was Chandler! ,
5062," It doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far? ",5," Well, what did you have? ",
5063," Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird turtle-man? ",7," What are you doing here, Santa? ",
5064," Honey, I know youre in pain right now, but Im a little turned on. _B_ ",1," Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah Ooh Oohh Ohh Oh God Ohh Oh Ohh Ohhhh ",
5065," You dont owe me anything, I dont want you money ",1," Give me a number, I dont want to owe you anything! ",
5066," Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall. _B_ ",2," But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor? ",
5067, What?! ,3,"  Hey, you know our phone's not working? ",
5068," Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches. ",4, Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it? ,
5069, Ok!  ,7,"  Hey, listen. Call me. ",
5070, Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.  ,1," No, I'll do it.  ",
5071," Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there. ",6, You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone. ,
5072, We have to assign heads to something. ,2, Yes! Whew! ,
5073," Alright, hang on a second there Custer. ",3," No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. ",
5074,  Chelsea. ,6, What woman?! ,
5075, What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela? ,6," All right, look, look, youve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy. ",
5076, SoYou got in voluntarily?! ,7," Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didnt think big enough to fit a grown man! ",
5077," Oh, dont say that! Dont say that. Thats not true. Is it? ",3," No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldve just stepped aside. ",
5078, Yeah baby! ,9," Uh-huh, not as high as  It worked! King! ",
5079, And you're okay with that? ,3," Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work? ",
5080," Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"" ",2," Go on, teach me something about men and women. ",
5081, Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay! ,7," Yknow uh, actually I-I-I should get going. ",
5082,  Im right here! ,7," Hey well, you cant teach someone to be good with women. Yknow, thats why I never had any luck with Chandler. ",
5083,"  Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and dont talk to anyone. ",7, I really wish that you wouldnt. ,
5084," Well, I feel like a snack! ",5,  I can do an English accent?! That babys going on my résumé! _B_ ,
5085, Hes coming into the audience. Hes coming into the audience. ,5,  For Im loved by a pretty wonderful boy!  Hello! And welcome to the show. I see some of our regulars in the audience. And a couple of irregulars.  ,
5086," Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'! ",9," You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? ",
5087, Oh dear God! ,1, Fine.  Shes wearing my bra! ,
5088," Well, lets just say its ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself. ",6, Why? You saw it? Is it scary? ,
5089, Tell it to the Time Turtle! ,3,"  Oh.  Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second! ",
5090, You said that to me last week. ,4, Can you hear me say you're grounded? ,
5091, Wrong number? ,2," Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.  ",
5092,"  Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says ""Rangers"" on it. They went to the game! ",0," Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking! ",
5093, Fancy. ,6, Everyday use. ,
5094,  New York is awesome! ,9," Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming. ",
5095," Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go. ",1," Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. ",
5096," Yeah, okay. ",2, Nooo! ,
5097," Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? ",5, He's... new. ,
5098," Yeah, Ill go get one. ",5," They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer? ",
5099," What?  What are you, what are you talking about? ",4," All right, youre probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out. ",
5100," Freedom! I want my freedom! Why wont you here me?!  Sophie, help me! Help me!!  ",3, Ill take all of your photos and put them into photo albums! ,
5101," Well, yknow, youre-youre gonna meet somebody! Youre a great catch! Yknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnt have to lie once.  ",4," Oh! See just Im right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!  ",
5102, What? ,4, I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work. ,
5103," Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked! ",2, Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success. ,
5104, I do not hate Ross! ,0," That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross! ",
5105, What? ,4,  No-no! Don't do it! Don't! ,
5106, Thanks.  ,9, You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you. ,
5107," Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. _B_ ",1, You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing! ,
5108, Not 700 exactly? ,0," Uh,  wow, 700. ",
5109, Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible! ,4," Well, yknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think Im just gonna take Sebastian to the charity. ",
5110," So do you think uh, Joeys more charming than me? ",8," Thats not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow Im not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.  Well, actually I got a little bit saved for you Pheebs.  ",
5111,"  Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me. ",3, And shes back in the game. _B_ ,
5112, What? ,4," I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember? ",
5113," Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! ",1, I couldn't even if I wanted to. _B_ ,
5114, Howdy doody. ,5, Sure.  _B_ ,
5115," Oh thats all right sir, and thats just one girl. ",7," Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh? ",
5116," I dont know, five hundred dollars? ",3," Ah-ah-ah! Were doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those? ",
5117,"  I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off! ",0," I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. ",
5118, This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants. ,8, Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache? ,
5119, What? ,4,  Y'know what's weird? ,
5120, Work people? Nobody told me. ,0," Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people. ",
5121," You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya? End",7," Oh, thank you.  ",
5122," Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy! ",8, Hi ,
5123,"  Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man! ",3," Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. ",
5124, What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday? _B_ ,7," Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. ",
5125, Can I be that guy? _B_ ,4," Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?  ",
5126,"  Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here? ",8, Where in Cuba? _B_ ,
5127," Hey, Lowell. ",7,"  Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. Closing Credits _B_ ",
5128," Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, its gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow Im conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free. ",1," Okay, well be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today? ",
5129, BEND OVER?!!! _B_ ,4," I was tryin to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what Im gonna do? ",

5131," Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub. ",7, Oh my God!  ,
5132,"  Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done. ",6, Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work. ,
5133, It's true. ,9, No way! ,
5134," Oh, hey guys! ",9, Hey! Look who I found! ,
5135," Oh no-no-no, thats notNo-no-no! ",2," Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I dont feel that way about you. ",
5136, Pheebs!! ,9,  Speech! Speech! Lets hear from the birthday girl! Huh? ,
5137, Oh no thanks. I dont like anything from my Scottish heritage. ,5, Do you want some shortbread? Eh thats Scottish like you are. ,
5138," See Joe, not that thats not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Yknow, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us! ",8, Yes! ,
5139, And yet you dont recognize that youre crazy. ,9, My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap! ,
5140," Please, one ridiculous problem at a time! ",0, I look like a man' ,
5141, That's great! ,9, It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list. ,

5143, Fancy guest. ,1, Guest. ,
5144," Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know. ",6, What is with you? ,
5145," If you guys feel this big , maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel. ",1," I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys. ",
5146," And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. _B_ ",8," And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. _B_ ",
5147," I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up. ",0," What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. ",
5148, Yeah! All right! You go first. ,8, Yeah? ,
5149," Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us. ",1," No, that's not exactly what I was.. ",
5150," Well, hello! ",6," No, no, no, dont get up, I got a cooler right here. _B_ ",
5151, Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four? ,6, The Geller Cup. ,
5152, Hi. ,8, Hello. ,
5153, Then why didnt you tell me to do that?!! ,1, He loves you. ,
5154," Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right? ",9, Really? ,
5155," It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything. ",6,  My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages. ,
5156, Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked! ,8, I did not! ,
5157, What picture? ,5, Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture. ,
5158, Double it!  ,9, Yeah. ,
5159," Yeah, you wish.  ",7, Yeah! Thats why Im sleeping with him on the side. ,
5160," Now Monica, I know youre upset, but dont forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theres going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris. ",1," I cant believe her, yknow its justits so typical. ",
5161, Im still right here! ,8," Hey! No-no-no-no, you cant take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!! ",
5162,"  Its a nickname, Ill explain later. ",4, Hello Skidmark. ,
5163," You bet I did, Ben, put it there!   Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small!  Ho, ho, ho! ",0," Did you bring me any presents, Santa? ",
5164, Ross is Batman! ,7, Really?! Commercial Break _B_ ,
5165," Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!  _B_ ",2, She's bluffing! ,
5166," Oh relax man, relax. Youre looking a little flushed. ",9, Thats funny. Yeah. Yknow youre the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear. ,
5167, Its a hand. Its a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder. ,6, BingWhats this?!  ,
5168," Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots. ",1," Okay, five hundred dollars. What else? ",
5169," Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache! ",2," Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him. ",
5170, I know. ,5, This doesn't feel weird! ,
5171," You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person. ",2," No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza. ",
5172," Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back. ",1," Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross. ",
5173," Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party. ",3, Tell me about it. ,
5174," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-! _B_ ",0," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  Hey, that's not for you, bitch!  _B_ ",
5175, Im here to see Mary-Angela. ,6, Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you? ,
5176, So how's it going there in Financial Services? ,8," Hey, Chandler. ",
5177," Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!! ",9,  Fights over!  _B_ ,
5178,   Coffee house? ,5,  WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!! ,

5180, Okay.  ,5, Okay. ,
5181, Tickets please!  Thats courtside baby! ,5, I dont know! ,
5182, Again true. ,9, Well that's pathetic! ,
5183, I'm not a dropper! ,3," Oh yeah, that's right! ",
5184," Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter. ",7," Yknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden. ",
5185, No-noReally?! ,6," Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better. ",
5186," Well its just my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.  ",3, What?! ,
5187," No, not us  Us!  ",2," Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember? ",
5188, Heres another plan No! ,3, Heres the plan! Okay? Im going to leave you get a look at Brendas bra! ,
5189,  Oh come on!! ,2, Id like to spin the wheel!  ,
5190, Nngghhh!!!!!!! ,6," Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? ",
5191," You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand! ",8," It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here! ",
5192, Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming? ,8,  Oh! Great! So how much does it pay?  _B_ ,
5193, Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?  _B_ ,8, Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...  ,
5194, Joey's tailor...took advantage of me. ,9,"  Hey, what's goin' on?  ",

5681,  Yeah? ,7, Chandler! ,
5682," I, I know. _B_ _B_ ",5," It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just... ",

5702, Which is why you should do it. ,8, Hey! Its your bachelor party. ,
5703, Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out. ,9, I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it. ,
